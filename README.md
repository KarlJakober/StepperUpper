# StepperUpper
An automated application to ease STEP (and similar) modpack setup.

Note: this documentation is outdated.  I'll get to proper documentation [later](https://github.com/airbreather/StepperUpper/issues/29).

Building
--

Requires Visual Studio 2017 to build.  Community Edition RC is what I use, and it works just fine.

Don't forget to clone recursively (`git clone `**`--recursive`**)  to get [AirBreather.Common](https://github.com/airbreather/AirBreather.Common) into the "External" folder.

Usage
--

See the [wiki](https://github.com/airbreather/StepperUpper/wiki) for requirements, usage instructions, and additional details.
